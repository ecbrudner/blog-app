# blog-app
[Deployed Application Link]()

## Description

I created this app to enable the user to join an online community where they can share blog posts and read the blog posts of others. In the coding community, this is a great way to keep up to date on new technologies and prevalent issues. In creating this project, I was able to practice using the MVC paradigm and incorporating MySQL and handlebars, along with my working knowledge of Express and Node.

## Installation

In order to use the app, the user will need both Node.js, MySQL2, Sequelize. [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) are instructions for installing Node. [Here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide) are instructions for installing MySQL2. [Here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) are instructions for installing Sequelize.

## Usage

When the user visits the deployed app, they can view the homepage to see blog posts and they can click on a blog post to see the comment section. If the user wants to make their own posts or leave comments, they will need to sign up. Once the user has signed up, they will have access to a dashboard where all of their posts will live. When the user clicks on their own post, they will see the options to update their post or delete their post. Additionally, when a logged in user clicks onto another person's post on the homepage, they will be presented with the option to leave a comment.
